# MT_fieldAPP

Matlab app for  managing magnetotelluric (MT) field projects. 
This includes handling the metadata, viewing the time series and power spectra, filtering noisy data, processing MT data, and viewing the processed EDI files.

Mostly set for MT data collected with LEMI-423 instruments, but we've used it with MTU-5C and EDL data as well.

You'll need to change the code to send the data to your own processing script, at UoA we use a variation of BIRRP. 

Works with matlab 2022b.
